# pdf-to-text
Simple Python code to extract PDFs into txt.

pdf-to-text was designed to extract information from large PDFs and save it to .txt files in order to use with ChatGPT.
I had a problem: I had a huge amount of PDFs files that I wanted ChatGPT to train on, but it wasn't able to read it all, so pdf-to-text was made in order to save everything in a .txt files to upload it to ChatGPT.
